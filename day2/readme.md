### `**git clone**`
is a Git command line utility which is used to target an existing repository and create a clone, or copy of the target repository. In this page we'll discuss extended configuration options and common use cases of `git clone`.
**Cloning to a specific folder**
`git clone <repo> <directory>`
**Cloning a specific tag**
`git clone --branch <tag> <repo>`
Clone the repository located at `＜repo＞` and only clone the ref for `＜tag＞`.
